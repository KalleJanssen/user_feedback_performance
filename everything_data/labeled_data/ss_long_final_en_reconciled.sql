The developers hope you are too lazy to turn location services to \"never\" when closing Waze. This is so they can track you 24/7, build a profile on you, and sell it to third parties. They will NEVER give their customers the \"while using\" option for location services for this reason, even though thousands are demanding it. In their eyes, the customer is always wrong. Until you change this, you have one less customer. \n\nUpdate: I\'m docking one more star because there\'s still no option for \"only while using\" in location services. I\'m still sick of having to turn location services on and off before and after using the app. And I don\'t care what the Waze developers say on Twitter, it DOES drain the battery when set to \"always\". I\'d have a heart attack if they actually have us said option, but sadly they never will because it would kill their ad revenue. That\'s the real reason that they won\'t give us the \"while using\" option!\n\nThe number of people requesting the option of \"While using the app\" is huge from reading reviews here and on Twitter etc. Waze must have an ulterior motive for not adding this option. The constant tracking of customers 24/7 is completely unnecessary not to mention the excessive battery drain it causes. Waze claims the \"always\" option is for planned drives and traffic updates which keep the planned drive time updated. I don\'t use planned drives. I instinctively know when it\'s time for me to leave for my drive. THE SOLUTION IS VERY SIMPLE: Leave \"Always\" as an option for people who use planned drives, and add \"While using the app\" for people who don\'t use planned drives, don\'t like being tracked (spied on) 24/7, and don\'t want excessive battery drain.

As it stands now, standard (not secret) chats have the potential of being seen, read, logged, and monitored by third parties including the company behind Telegram, hackers, government agencies, and others.\n\n4.
